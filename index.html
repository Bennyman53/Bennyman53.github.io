      <h2>About Worms</h2>
        
          
            <li>Worms are invertebrate animals belonging to the phylum Annelida.</li>
           <li>They are known for their elongated, cylindrical body shape and lack of limbs.</li>
            <li>Worms are found in various habitats, including soil, freshwater, and marine environments.</li>
            <li>They come in different sizes, ranging from a few millimeters to several meters in length.</li>

      <h2>Types of Worms</h2>
      
        <li>Earthworms: Earthworms are the most well-known type of worm, commonly found in soil. They play a vital role in soil health and nutrient cycling.</li>
        <li>Marine Worms: Marine worms inhabit oceans and seas, ranging from tiny organisms to larger species like the bristleworms.</li>
        <li>Parasitic Worms: Parasitic worms, such as tapeworms and roundworms, live in or on other organisms and can cause diseases in humans and animals.</li>

      <h2>Worm Anatomy</h2>
      
        <li>Worms typically have a long, segmented body with specialized segments that serve different functions.</li>
        <li>Movement: Worms move through the use of muscles and bristles (setae) on their body segments.</li>
        <li>Sensory Organs: While worms lack well-developed eyes, they have light-sensitive cells and <br> sensory receptors to detect touch, chemicals, and vibrations.</li>

    <section class="Importance">
      <h2>Importance</h2>
      
        <li>Soil Health: Earthworms enhance soil structure and fertility by aerating the soil and breaking down organic matter.</li>
        <li>Nutrient Cycling: Worms consume organic debris, digest it, and excrete nutrient-rich castings, which enrich the soil.</li>
        <li>Food Chain: Worms serve as an essential food source for various animals, such as birds, amphibians, and small mammals.</li>
